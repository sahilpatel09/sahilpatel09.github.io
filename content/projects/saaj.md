# SAAJ - Personal Cloud Streaming Service

I do not listen to a lot of things, just few of some I really like. And I do have everything on my phone and laptop. Everything just worked fine but now I thought put it on a media management thing. Not a big one, a small one to just handle what I want.


I looked around all the open-source options. There are a lots of projects available but I do not want anything fancy. Just a simple server with a front-end. May be in future I would think of adding some functionalities.
