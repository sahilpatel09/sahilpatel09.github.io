If you missed this exciting release you can catch up in the blog post What’s New in Gatsby 4 after following this tutorial.</p>\n<p>So why should you care about Deferred Static Generation? In a nutshell it delays (or defers) the generation of pages until a user actually requests the page. After that the build artifacts (HTML &#x26; JSON) are cached at the CDN level and for all visitors afterwards it behaves like a normal SSG page. In a scenario where you build thousands of pages but only a subset of them gets regular visits from users, DSG can dramatically improve your build speeds. And you still get the SSG benefits like great SEO, speed, and reliability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"problem\"><a href=\"#problem\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link heading-anchor\"></span></a>Problem</h2>\n<p>Recently while updating with <a href=\"https://github.com/Upstatement/skela-wp-theme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skela</a> with webpack, I encountered a weird error where I wasn't able to run a simple script:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell:title=bin/composer\">#!/bin/bash\ndocker-compose exec -w /var/www/html/wp-content/themes/skela wordpress composer \"$@\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>When trying to run this script via <code>./bin/composer install</code>, I got this error in my terminal:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">ERROR: Setting workdir for exec is not supported in API &#x3C; 1.35 (1.30)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The error was coming from the <code>-w</code> flag in the <code>docker-compose exec</code> command in the <code>composer</code> script.</p>\n<h1 id=\"solution\"><a href=\"#solution\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link heading-anchor\"></span></a>Solution</h1>\n<p>Turns The fix was to update the version in my <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file to from version <code>3.5</code> to <code>3.6</code>. It's strange because 3.5 isn't anywhere close to the API version <code>1.35</code> from the error message 🤷‍♀️</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">&#x3C;&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html>\n&#x3C;html>\n&#x3C;head>\n    &#x3C;meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    &#x3C;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n    &#x3C;title>&#x3C;/title>\n&#x3C;/head>\n&#x3C;body>\n\n&#x3C;/body>\n&#x3C;/html>\n</code></pre>\n","tags":[{"title":"Vue.js","path":"/tag/Vue.js/"}]}},"context":{}}
