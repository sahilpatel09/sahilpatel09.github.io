## Hello world!

This is where your content goes

Gatsby 4 introduced a lot of new features, most notably the introduction of additional rendering options besides Static Site Generation (SSG): Deferred Static Generation (DSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR). If you missed this exciting release you can catch up in the blog post What’s New in Gatsby 4 after following this tutorial.

So why should you care about Deferred Static Generation? In a nutshell it delays (or defers) the generation of pages until a user actually requests the page. After that the build artifacts (HTML & JSON) are cached at the CDN level and for all visitors afterwards it behaves like a normal SSG page. In a scenario where you build thousands of pages but only a subset of them gets regular visits from users, DSG can dramatically improve your build speeds. And you still get the SSG benefits like great SEO, speed, and reliability.

## Problem

Recently while updating with [Skela](https://github.com/Upstatement/skela-wp-theme) with webpack, I encountered a weird error where I wasn't able to run a simple script:

```shell:title=bin/composer
#!/bin/bash
docker-compose exec -w /var/www/html/wp-content/themes/skela wordpress composer "$@"
```

When trying to run this script via `./bin/composer install`, I got this error in my terminal:

```shell
ERROR: Setting workdir for exec is not supported in API < 1.35 (1.30)
```

The error was coming from the `-w` flag in the `docker-compose exec` command in the `composer` script.

# Solution

Turns The fix was to update the version in my `docker-compose.yml` file to from version `3.5` to `3.6`. It's strange because 3.5 isn't anywhere close to the API version `1.35` from the error message 🤷‍♀️

```shell
<<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
	<title></title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar


## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code


Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

``` js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```
