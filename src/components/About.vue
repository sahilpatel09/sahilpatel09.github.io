        <p class="max-w-4xl mb-4 text-base text-lightest-slate sm:mx-auto">
          I have a double diploma, in Software Engineering and Software Testing.
          It gives me strength knowing SDLCs in developement as well as
          different methodologies in testing like Agile. I had started my career
          being a WordPress developer doing Digital Marketing along side. I have
          also done many small projects in Python as well. At the moment I am
          practicing my Vue JS skills and learning API development with Node.
          Now I am looking better opportunities in Front-end development.
          Recently I have been doing a lot of open source contributions on
          Github. Most of my work is in WordPress sites, so building better
          portfolio on Github. I like to read books and also write poetry on
          Medium.
