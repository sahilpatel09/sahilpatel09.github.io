I have been thinking to make some new projects lately. It's been 2 days since I have been thinking of making something that can help others as well leaarn from me. At last only one thing struck my mind and it was to make a simple finance app which has a lot of CRUD operations. 

A lot of people today want to learn so many things but the internet is a rabbithole to learn new things. No one teaches students from the base to start. College freshers do not know how the project is handeled from start ot finish, what are the project lifecycles! 


# FinoCrunch

Well, here is the name, FinoCrunch. Why did I choose this name? This name was not taken, simple. I searched on google for hours to find a good name but usually all the names were taken somewhere. Being a hardcore SEO person I really wanted to find something which is cool to pronounce and easy to remember and not used before. I do not know if this name has been used before but Google said NO. So, I will go with it.

# Techstack

Techstack is the heart of any Web Development project. This app for sure is not going to use conventional techstack route. Instead, we are going to leverage help from Supabase for our backend system. Initially, I thought to build the whole app from scratch with PEVN ( Postgres, Express, Vue.js , Node.js ) stack but then why do we need to build the whole system from scratch!?

I have heard of Supabase a lot lately, and wanted to give a try to their PostgreSQL database. Here, we are building our FinoCrunch with,<br> <code>Vue3, Supabase ( Auth, PostgreSQL ), TailwindCSS</code>

# Functionalities

At, the moment I have thought of very basic functionlities, which are as below:
* Login & Registration page
* Dashboard - Cards, Transactions, Charts & Statistics
* Support for UPI Payments ( Indian Payments System )
* ... more en route

Stay tuned to here more my project. You can always find all the new blog posts in the FinoCrunch tag. Thank You.
